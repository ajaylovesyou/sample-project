# Placeholder Project

This repository contains a unique and customizable framework for generating art using procedural generation and AI. Below are some details about what this project does and how to get started!

## Features

- **Procedural Generation**: Generates patterns and art procedurally from a seeded random value.
- **Image Manipulation**: Provides a suite of tools to manipulate generated output, including filters and blending techniques.
- **AI Integration**: Uses pre-trained AI models to enhance art quality or style using neural transfer techniques.
- **Customizable Seed**: Allows users to create reproducible outputs while adding modifiers to experiment with different styles.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajaylovesyou/sample-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project's directory:

   ```bash
   cd sample-project
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start up the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- Use the provided web interface to generate art interactively.
- Experiment with modifying seed numbers to observe pattern variations.
- Export your art in various formats including PNG and SVG.
